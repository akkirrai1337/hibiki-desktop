/**
 * Regenerates src/shared/profileRules.vectors.json from the real implementation.
 *
 * The point is a single, language-neutral statement of what the profile rules do, that both this
 * app and the Android one can be tested against. XP, levels, achievement tiers and streaks are
 * about to exist twice - once in TypeScript here, once in Kotlin there - and two implementations
 * of the same arithmetic drift silently: the same watch history quietly becomes level 7 on the
 * desktop and level 6 on the phone, with nothing to point at.
 *
 * Generated rather than hand-written, so the expectations cannot be wrong about what this code
 * currently does. Reviewing the diff of this file is how a deliberate rule change gets noticed;
 * profileRules.test.ts fails if the code moves without it.
 *
 * Usage: npx tsx scripts/generateProfileVectors.ts
