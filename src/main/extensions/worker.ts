// Worker-thread entry point: runs extension calls off Electron's main thread. An extension's
// fetch()/challenge()/browserFetch() globals are *synchronous* (they match the Rhino runtime the
// scripts were written for), so executing one blocks whichever thread it runs on for the whole
// duration of its network work - on the main thread that means the window, IPC and rendering all
// freeze. Here it blocks only this worker.
//
// This used to be one worker per call, spawned and thrown away. Booting one costs ~195ms on this
// machine before a single line of extension code runs - almost all of it parsing this bundle
// (cheerio, for the Jsoup shim) - and the app pays that on every search keystroke, every catalog
// card and every resolver attempt. So the worker now stays alive and serves calls in a loop, and
// runtime.ts keeps a small pool of them (see WorkerPool there).
//
// One call at a time per worker, and that is not negotiable: an extension call blocks this thread
// inside Atomics.wait() while the main thread services its bridge request, so a second call
// arriving mid-flight could not run anyway - it would just sit in the port's queue. The pool's job
// is to hand each in-flight call its own worker.

// to the main thread instead (see netFetchHost.ts). Kept anyway, because without it that fallback
// doesn't merely run slowly, it hangs: sync-fetch blocks on execFileSync(process.execPath, ...),
// which inside Electron is the Electron binary, and without this variable that child tries to boot
// as a second GUI app instead of as plain Node, so it never writes the output being waited on.
