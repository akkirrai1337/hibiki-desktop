// Main-thread HTTP for extension scripts' synchronous `fetch()` global (see globals.ts), reached
// from the worker over the existing Atomics bridge (syncHostBridge.ts).
//
// What this replaces, and why: `fetch()` in an extension has to *return* its response, not a
// Promise - the scripts are ports of Rhino code and are written straight through. That was
// implemented with the `sync-fetch` package, which gets its synchrony by spawning a whole child
// process of `process.execPath` per request and blocking on execFileSync. Inside Electron
// `process.execPath` is the Electron binary, so every single HTTP request an extension made paid
// for a fresh ~90ms Electron/Node boot (measured on this machine, warm; a cold or AV-scanned start
// is far worse) - and, being a new process each time, could never reuse a TCP connection or a TLS
// session. Resolving one Kodik embed makes three requests to the same origin: three process
// spawns, three TCP handshakes, three TLS handshakes, for data a single pooled connection serves.
//
// Worse than slow, it could hang forever: sync-fetch passes no timeout to execFileSync and none to
// node-fetch inside the child, so a stalled connect (routine for Kodik's domains on some Russian
// ISPs - the very case this app hits) blocked the worker until runtime.ts's 30s kill, with no way
// to tell that apart from a genuine failure. Everything below runs on the main thread's normal
// async stack instead, where undici's global pool keeps connections alive across requests and an
// AbortSignal gives every request a real deadline.
