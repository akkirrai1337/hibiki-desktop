// Follows a playback URL's redirects in the main process and reports where it actually lands.
//
// Why this has to happen outside the renderer: playback CDNs load-balance with a cross-origin
// redirect (Kodik hands out p14.solodcdn.com and immediately 302s to p13, verified live), and a
// redirect is the weakest point of a renderer-side stream fetch. hls.js loads the manifest by XHR,
// so the whole chain is subject to CORS - and these CDNs send no Access-Control-Allow-Origin at
// all. playerHeaders.ts papers over that by injecting one onto every response, but a *redirected*
// CORS request has to pass the check on the redirect hop too, and anything that goes wrong there
// surfaces to hls.js as status 0 with no diagnostic at all - which is exactly what an exported log
// showed for a Kodik stream that had resolved perfectly 29ms earlier.
//
// Here there is no CORS, no origin and no opinion about redirects, so the chain can simply be
// walked. Handing hls.js the final URL means its request never redirects in the first place, which
// removes the failure rather than retrying through it - and relative segment URLs resolve against
// that final URL, so they follow the stream to the same host instead of bouncing per segment.
