// Some sources require request headers (Referer, User-Agent, ...) that the Fetch/XHR spec

// injected is Electron's session-level webRequest API in the main process, keyed by origin (an
// HLS playlist's segment requests share the manifest's origin but not its exact URL, so exact-URL
// keying would miss them).

// Response-side counterpart of the request-header injection above: hls.js fetches the manifest

// don't bother sending Access-Control-Allow-Origin at all, since they only ever expected to be
// loaded from a matching <video>/native player, not cross-origin JS. The Referer/User-Agent
// injection above can't fix that (CORS is decided by the *response* headers, not the request).
//
// This was originally scoped to just the origin of the master playlist URL we registered headers
// for, on the assumption that's the only origin involved - wrong in practice: a multi-bitrate HLS
// stream's master playlist commonly points sub-playlists/segments at a *different* CDN host (seen
// live: Miruro's master playlist resolves through repackager.wixmp.com but the actual segments
// come from video.wixstatic.com), so scoping by "the one URL we know about" left every other host
// in the same stream still blocked, and the player just spun on "buffering" forever with no error
// surfaced anywhere. This app's renderer never browses arbitrary untrusted pages (only its own
// UI and whatever a source extension resolves for playback), so relaxing CORS session-wide is a
// safe trade here.
